Replace this statement with external documentation that 
a new user could use to know how (and why) to use your program.
The
[Assembler PP assignment](www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/AssemblerProj.html)
states that the external documentation should
include a description of your program, along with some
sample input and sample output (which need not be the same as your
test file(s), since the point of the sample input/output is
to help with your description), and instructions on how to run the
program.  The <a href="/CSShared/pgmStyle.html">Program Style Guide</a>
has a little more information on what should be included in external
documentation.
